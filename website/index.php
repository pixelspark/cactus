<img align="right" src="screenshot_cactus.gif"/>Welcome to the website of the cactus3d project. Cactus3d is a small, opensource software 3d engine. The engine is ported from Java to C++. The original engine is called <a href="http://www.idx3d.ch">idx3dIII</a> and was written by Peter Walser. The API of Cactus3d looks a lot like the idx3dIII API. We're continuosly adding features to cactus3d. <br/><br/>
<b>Project status</b><br/>
At the moment, we have ported the most important features from idx3dIII. We have tested cactus3d solely on win32 at the moment, but if you want to port to/test on linux, we'd appreciate.
